xref:src/g.py[g.py] contains a few imports.

Commenting out all other variants and <<Running>> the code, all four variants yield the same result (`Hi there!` is printed).

However, triggering editor.action.showDefinitionPreviewHover on `f` works only in the first two variants.

## Running

`python3 -m src.g`
